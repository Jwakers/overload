### Phase 6: Polish & Testing

- [ ] **Error Handling**

  - [ ] Form validation
  - [ ] Error boundaries
  - [ ] User feedback messages

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**

  - [ ] Implement proper loading states
  - [ ] Optimize database queries
  - [ ] Add caching where appropriate

  - [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics

### Phase 8: Post MVP

- [ ] User profile management
- [ ] Exercises synonyms to make search more effective
- [ ] Start new workout button should say resume if there is an active workout. The drawer can be closed by accident this allows the user to quickly resume what they were doing
- [ ] When starting a new workout we should query if there are any other workouts created today and if so offer to resume or create a new one.
- [ ] Filter by muscle group AND equipment
- [ ] Improve the muscle group system
- [ ] Enforce only one active workout session (when requesting a new one all others should be set to isActive === false). No user should ever have multiple active sessions

## üöÄ Recommended Development Order

1. **Start with Phase 1** (setup) - this gives you the foundation
2. **Move to Phase 2** (database) - this defines your data structure
3. **Implement Phase 3** (core features) incrementally
4. **Build UI components** as you develop features
5. **Add advanced features** once core functionality works
6. **Polish and test** before deployment

## üîß Key Technical Considerations

- **Convex**: Use real-time subscriptions for live workout updates
- **Shadcn**: Leverage their component library for consistent UI
- **Clerk**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **Performance**: Use optimistic updates for better UX during workouts
- **Data Structure**: Design for efficient querying of workout history and progression

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Convex (built on top of PostgreSQL)

## üéØ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Convex: `npx convex dev`
4. Set up environment variables for Clerk
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`
