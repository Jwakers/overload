## üöÄ Recommended Development Order

1. **Start with Phase 1** (setup) - this gives you the foundation
2. **Move to Phase 2** (database) - this defines your data structure
3. **Implement Phase 3** (core features) incrementally
4. **Build UI components** as you develop features
5. **Add advanced features** once core functionality works
6. **Polish and test** before deployment

## üîß Key Technical Considerations

- **Convex**: Use real-time subscriptions for live workout updates
- **Shadcn**: Leverage their component library for consistent UI
- **Clerk**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **Performance**: Use optimistic updates for better UX during workouts
- **Data Structure**: Design for efficient querying of workout history and progression

## üìö Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Convex
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Convex (built on top of PostgreSQL)

## üéØ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Convex: `npx convex dev`
4. Set up environment variables for Clerk
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`
